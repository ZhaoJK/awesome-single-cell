## recount3
[Book](http://rna.recount.bio/docs/)
[Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/recount3/inst/doc/recount3-quickstart.html)
an online resource consisting of RNA-seq gene, exon, and exon-exon junction counts as well as coverage bigWig files for 8,679 and 10,088 different studies for human and mouse respectively. It is the third generation of the ReCount project and part of recount.bio.

### Overview  
The recount3 R/Bioconductor package is an interface to the recount3 project. recount3 provides uniformly processed RNA-seq data for hundreds of thousands of samples. The R package makes it possible to easily retrieve this data in standard Bioconductor containers, including RangedSummarizedExperiment. The sections on terminology and available data contains more detail on those subjects.

### Bioconductor
The main documentation website for all the recount3-related projects is available at recount.bio. Please check that website for more information about how this R/Bioconductor package and other tools are related to each other.
