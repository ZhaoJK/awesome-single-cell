CellphoneDB is a suite to study cell-cell communication from single-cell transcriptomics data. Identifying ligand–receptor interactions from scRNA-seq requires both the annotation of complex ligand–receptor relationships from the literature (i.e. database) and a statistical method that integrates the resource with scRNA-seq data and selects relevant interactions from the dataset (ie.e tool). CellphoneDB is composed of two units, a database and a tool.  

CellphoneDB database is a publicly available repository of curated receptors, ligands and their interactions. Subunit architecture is included for both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. This is crucial, as cell-cell communication relies on multi-subunit protein complexes that go beyond the binary representation used in most databases and studies. It integrates new manually reviewed interactions with evidenced roles in cell-cell communication together with existing datasets that pertain to cellular communication (such as *Shilts et al. 2022* and *Kanemaru et al. 2023*). Recently, the database expanded to include non-protein molecules acting as ligands.  

The database can be used to search for a particular ligand/receptor or in combination with the tool to interrogate your own single-cell transcriptomics data.
