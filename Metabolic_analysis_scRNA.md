Compass 
Metabolic modeling using single-cell transcriptomes:
In-Silico Modeling of Metabolic Heterogeneity using Single-Cell Transcriptomes
Metabolism is a major regulator of immune cell function, but it remains difficult to study the metabolic status of individual cells. This motivated the development of Compass, an algorithm to characterize cellular metabolic states based on single-cell RNA-Seq and flux balance analysis (FBA).

COBRApy: A Python package for constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) of metabolic models. COBRApy can be used to build, analyze, and simulate metabolic models, including single-cell metabolic models.

Insilico Metabolic Network Generator (IMNG): A web-based tool for generating metabolic networks from protein sequence data. IMNG can be used to generate single-cell metabolic models from single-cell RNA-seq data.

TIGER: A tool for inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell RNA-seq data. TIGER can be used to infer gene regulatory networks that can then be used to predict metabolic fluxes.

scMAGNET: A tool for inferring metabolic activity from single-cell RNA-seq data. scMAGNET uses a machine learning approach to predict metabolic activity from gene expression data.

CellNet: A tool for integrating single-cell RNA-seq data, single-cell proteomics data, and metabolic models to infer cellular networks. CellNet can be used to infer the interactions between genes, proteins, and metabolites in single cells.
